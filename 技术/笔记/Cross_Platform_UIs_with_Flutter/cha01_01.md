### 两种Widget

StatelessWidget: This kind of widget doesn’t require a mutable state and is best used to describe those parts of the UI that never change. Stateless widgets are immutable.

<u>这种Widget无需状态(可变的状态)，用于构建UI中不会改变的部分，它在整个生命周期中都不会被改变。</u>

StatefulWidget: This kind of widget has a mutable state and is generally used when the developer needs to control the widget’s life cycle or dynamic contents. Stateful widgets are immutable too.

<u>这种Widget会带有可变状态，状态用于控制Widget中可变的部分。但Widget本身是不可改变的，跟StatelessWidget一样。</u>

### Widget更新

A StatefulWidget itself is immutable but its state is mutable, and it’s represented by a separated `State<T>` object. Whenever the UI needs to be updated, Flutter follows this logic:

- If a widget is initialized with a const constructor, then nothing special happens and the framework just skips to the next child. This is one of the main reasons why you should try to use constant constructors as much as possible.

- If a widget isn’t initialized with a const constructor, then it’s removed and regenerated with a new one. This is totally fine; Flutter has been built for this exact purpose and is really fast at replacing widgets.

<u>StatefulWidget本身是不可变的，但它的state是可变的，state类型为`State<T>`，当UI需要更新时，Flutter会执行下面的逻辑：</u>

- <u>如果widget创建实例时用的const修饰，Flutter会直接跳过对该widget的检查，这也是我们要尽可能使用const的原因。</u>

- <u>如果widget创建实例时未用const，Flutter会删除它，并创建一个新实例补上。</u>

When Flutter rebuilds a widget, it uses the Element object associated with that widget to compare the old and new instances. In case of changes, the UI is updated; otherwise, nothing happens and the framework proceeds to visit the next child.

<u>当Flutter创建新的widget时，是通过与之关联的Element对象来处理相关逻辑的，通过Element对象拿到新旧widget，并将其进行对比，如果有改变，Flutter会继续更新UI，否则跳过，进入下一个widget。</u>

### State类几个方法说明

- **void initState(): **This method is called only once when the widget is created—it’s like the constructor of a widget.

- **void didChangeDependencies(): **This is called right after initState() and it’s used to perform initialization based on an InheritedWidget above it.

- **void didUpdateWidget(covariant T oldWidget): **This is called whenever the widget configuration changes. For example, this method is invoked whenever a widget’s parameter value is changed.
  
  <u>当widget的任何属性有改变的时候被调用</u>

- **void dispose(): **This is called when the widget is removed from the tree—it’s like the destructor of a widget.

### UI渲染

When it’s time to render the UI, Flutter traverses the widget tree and calls the build method of the various stateful or stateless widgets. At the same time, it builds the element and the render tree by calling `createElement()` and `createRenderObject()`, respectively, on the widget being built. The actual situation that the framework is dealing with in the end is shown in the following screenshot:

Here’s what’s actually happening under the hood:

1. Every widget has an associated Element object that holds the state (in the case of stateful widgets) and is used by the framework to detect changes on the widget that might require a repaint of the UI.
   
   <u>每一个Widget都有一个与之关联的Element对象，用于存储其状态(State对象，当然只有StatefulWidget才有)，Flutter通过state来检查widget的改变并决定是否要重绘UI。</u>

2. Elements are backed by a RenderObject that contains all the logic to paint graphics on the screen and is relatively expensive to create. It takes care of hit testing, painting, layout constraints, and much more.
   
   <u>Element的背后有RenderObject支持，它包含了所有图形绘制的逻辑，且创建该对象开销相对较大。还有相关的碰撞检查，绘图，布局约束等等也是有该对象负责。</u>

3. When a widget changes (using setState(), for example), the underlying element is marked as dirty and the framework triggers the build method to be called. Elements compare the differences between the old and the newly modified widget to update or recreate the render box.
   
   <u>当widget发生改变(一般是我们调用了setState方法)，Flutter会将该widget对应的element标记会‘脏’，并会调用该widget的build方法，并创建一个新的widget对象，此时Element会对新旧widget进行比较，找出不同的地方，然后决定是要更新还是要重新创建一个对应的RenderObject(render box)</u>

4. Render boxes are modified and kept in the framework’s cache as much as possible. They are recreated only when the widget type is different. They’re generally recreated only when the widget type changes or there are too many variations to apply. Updating or modifying a render object also updates the UI.
   
   <u>Flutter会尽可能多的缓存各种Render boxes，大部分情况下只会去修改缓存中的Render box，只有当新旧两个widget类型不一样，或者有太多的变化而无法应用时，新的Render box才会被创建。不管是更新还是修改render object，UI都会被更新。</u>

5. The RenderObject is the one that actually has instructions to paint the UI. The Flutter framework uses elements to decide which changes, if any, have to be applied to a render object.
   
   <u>RenderObject才是真正绘制UI的角色，绘制指令由它发出。而Element只是Flutter用来检查新旧Widget改变的，当Flutter发现有改变时，会将其应用到RenderObject上，继而重新绘制了UI。</u>

When you use the const constructor on a widget, you can save Element comparisons, RenderObject modifications, or (even better) recreations, plus other compiler and framework optimizations. Flutter already knows about the widget’s location on the tree; the BuildContext variable is nothing more than the framework giving you access to the element behind your widget.

<u>当使用const来实例化Widget时，可以省去Element对新旧Wdiget的对比，省去对RenderObject应用Widget的改变，或者RenderObject的重建，这些都会加快build过程。另外还会应用Flutter本身所做的一些编译优化。BuildContext其实就是Widget背后的Element对象。</u>

### Function VS Class

<u>在build方法中创建widget，有时为了拆分，我们可以通过一个函数来返回某块widget，也可以通过重新继承一个StatelessWidget或StatefulWidget来创建新的Widget，那这两者有何不同？下面是对于这两种创建widget的方法比较，函数的方式只有一个好处，那就是代码量比较少。但用Class方式好处却很多：</u>

1. They can have a constant constructor and allow for granular rebuilds.
   
   <u>创建widget时，可以用const，且对该widget的子级可以更细粒度的优化和使用const</u>

2. They can have keys.
   
   <u>可以通过Key来控制</u>

3. Flutter can skip the rebuild of a widget if it didn’t change by looking at its Element object.
   
   <u>当build方法重新执行的时候，如果widget没有改变，Flutter会省去很多工作。</u>

4. They’re well integrated into the Object Inspector, which may be essential in certain debugging scenarios.
   
   <u>方便通过调试器查看相关问题</u>

5. Hot reload always works as expected.
   
   <u>热重载也能正常工作</u>

6. There’s no risk of reusing some previous state because they correctly dispose of all the resources.
   
   <u>对于State对象的重用无风险，因为Class方式能正确销毁相关的State对象</u>

7. Since they have an Element object behind them, you can use the BuildContext object and its application programming interface (API).
   
   <u>非常方便的引用BuildContext对象</u>

8. They follow the single-responsibility principle (SRP) and lead to more maintainable, extensible, and testable code.
   
   <u>更方便代码的维护和扩展</u>
