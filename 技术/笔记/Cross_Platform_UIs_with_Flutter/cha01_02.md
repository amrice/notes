Flutter提供了相关的dart语法检查，代码风格，规范检查工具。

当创建Flutter项目的时候，默认会添加flutter_lints依赖，它主要检查语法问题，比如变量未使用，多余的import语句，会对代码做静态分析，提示在实例之前添加const关键字等

The flutter_lints package included in the file adds a series of static analysis rules recommended by the Flutter team.

但要更严格的规则和更细化的规范，我们需要dart_code_metrics。下面是一个使用的范例，可以将其应用到所有Flutter项目中。

```yaml
# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

analyzer:
  plugins:
    - dart_code_metrics

dart_code_metrics:
  metrics:
    cyclomatic-complexity: 20
    number-of-parameters: 4
    maximum-nesting-level: 5
  metrics-exclude:
    - test/**
    - build/**
  rules:
    - avoid-unused-parameters
    - avoid-wrapping-in-padding
    - binary-expression-operand-order
    - double-literal-format
    - no-object-declaration
    # - newline-before-return
    - no-boolean-literal-compare
    - no-empty-block
    - prefer-trailing-comma
    - prefer-conditional-expressions
    - no-equal-then-else
  anti-patterns:
    - long-method
    - long-parameter-list

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at
  # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/index.html.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  rules:
    avoid_print: false  # Uncomment to disable the `avoid_print` rule
    prefer_single_quotes: true  # Uncomment to enable the `prefer_single_quotes` rule
